        There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold <br />
        And she's buying a <strong>stairway to heaven</strong> <br />
        When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed<br />
        With a word she can get what she came for<br />
        Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a <strong>stairway to heaven</strong>
        <br /><br />
        There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure<br />
        'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings<br />
        In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings<br />
        Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven<br />
        You know<br /><br />
        There's a feeling I get when I look to the west<br />
        And my spirit is crying for leaving<br />
        In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees<br />
        And the voices of those who stand looking<br />
        That's you<br /><br />
        And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune<br />
        Then the piper will lead us to reason<br />
        And a new day will dawn for those who stand long<br />
        And the forests will echo with laughter<br />
        Remember laughter?<br /><br />
        Oh yeah, yeah, yeah...<br /><br />
        And it makes me wonder<br />
        If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now<br />
        It's just a spring clean for the May queen<br />
        Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run<br />
        There's still time to change the road you're on<br /><br />
        Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know<br />
        The piper's calling you to join him<br />
        Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know<br />
        Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?<br /><br />
        And as we wind on down the road<br />
        Our shadows taller than our soul<br />
        There walks a lady we all know<br />
        Who shines white light and wants to show<br />
        How everything still turns to gold<br /><br />
        And if you listen very hard<br />
        The tune will come to you at last<br />
        When all is one and one is all, that's what it is<br />
        To be a rock and not to roll, oh yeah<br /><br />
        And she's buying a <strong>stairway to heaven</strong>
